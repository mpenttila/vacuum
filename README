Authors: Markus Penttil√§, Aki Reijonen, Niko Kiirala

Compiling instructions (Linux):

Install Cornerstone SDK from Multitouch Oy (http://cornerstone.multitouch.fi) 
and setup the correct runtime configuration.
Install Qt development libraries.

Run 'qmake' in the program directory (/distort).
Run 'make' in the program directory.

Operating instructions:

The compiled executable named 'vacuum' takes as parameters:
--css style.css
--players number_of_players
--displaywidth width_in_millimeters
--mode distort   (where distort == flow, default mode is vacuum)
--start left     (default is start from right)
--density float_value (density of distractors)
--wordfile filename_prefix (default is targetwords, and the expected file is targetwords.1.txt for first player, targetwords.2.txt for second)

e.g. ./vacuum --css style.css --players 1 --displaywidth 518 --mode distort --density 0.5

Provided are run scripts run_distort.sh and run_vacuum.sh that can be edited for
correct display width.
